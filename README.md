# ElderCare AI

## Overview
ElderCare AI is a specialized virtual healthcare assistant designed to provide personalized support for elderly individuals (ages 60-80+). The AI offers tailored health guidance, medication reminders, lifestyle tips, and caregiver support based on user-specific medical history and past interactions. The system is fine-tuned on geriatric healthcare conversations to ensure relevance, safety, and accuracy.

## Features
- **Personalized Health Assistance**: Provides health tips and wellness guidance tailored to the userâ€™s condition.
- **Contextual Memory Awareness**: Remembers past conversations, medication schedules, and reported symptoms.
- **Elderly-Friendly Interaction**: Uses simple language, short responses, and step-by-step assistance.
- **Emergency Handling**: Recognizes high-risk symptoms and suggests immediate medical help.
- **Caregiver Support**: Offers updates and reminders for caregivers when needed.

## Functional Requirements
- Retains user health data for personalized recommendations.
- Asks only one question at a time to avoid overwhelming the user.
- Provides support for chronic conditions like arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes.
- Offers fall prevention tips and mobility assistance.
- Recommends lifestyle adjustments, including hydration, sleep, and nutrition.
- Avoids medical diagnoses and non-geriatric topics.
- Includes safe fallback handling for uncertain or critical health queries.

## Technical Specifications
- **Model**: Fine-tuned on Mistral 7B using ~10K geriatric healthcare dialogues.
- **Memory Handling**: External memory management for user health history and prior interactions.
- **Temperature Setting**: Optimized for factual accuracy and low hallucination (recommended ~0.3-0.5).
- **Data Handling**: Follows HIPAA-compliant data security standards.

## Dataset & Fine-Tuning
- Trained on 10,000+ real-world elderly healthcare interactions.
- Balanced across chronic disease management, lifestyle advice, and caregiver support.
- Edge cases included: emergency situations, loneliness support, and mobility issues.
- Dataset structure follows JSONL format with `input` and `output` fields.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and load the fine-tuned Mistral 7B model.
2. **Interaction**: Engage in a conversation by inputting elderly health-related queries.
3. **Memory-Enabled Conversations**: The AI adapts responses based on prior interactions.
4. **Emergency Response**: If serious symptoms are detected, the AI suggests contacting healthcare professionals.

## Limitations & Safety Measures
